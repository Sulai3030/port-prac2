        <h5 class="mt-0"> Middle Eastern Summer Salad</h5>
        <p>
          Summer is upon us which means two things, one, it is too hot to turn
          on the stove and two salads are at their apex of deliciousness.
        </p>

        <p>
          While I was walking the aisles of my local supermarket, I walked past
          a can of chickpeas and for some reason I grabbed it and put it in my
          cart along with some black beans. I had an idea.
        </p>
        “Lets make a Greek type salad I thought.” So I bought what in my mind
        were Greek seeming ingredients and set about making a sort of Greek
        salad.

        <p>
          Ingredients:
        </p>
        <p>For the Dressing:</p>
        <p>
          • 4 cloves diced garlic (less if you are sensitive to the strength of
          garlic but honestly the more the merrier!
        </p>
        <p>•3 Tablespoons of Lemon juice (1 fresh lemon)</p>
        <p>• 6 Tablespoons of Lime juice (2 fresh Limes)</p>
        <p>• 3 Tablespoons of Olive Oil plus more to taste</p>
        <p>• ¼ cup minced fresh Basil or 1/3 cup dried basil</p>
        <p>• 1 Tablespoon chopped Parsley</p>
        <p>• 1 Teaspoon Honey</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>•</p>
        <p>Salt (to taste)</p>
        <p>• Pepper</p>
        <p>• ¼ Teaspoon cayenne pepper</p>
        <p>• Dash Mint</p>
        <p>• Dash Oregano For the Salad:</p>
        <p>• 1 Can Chickpeas, drained</p>
        <p>• 1 Can Black beans, drained</p>
        <p>• ½ Cup diced onion (red onion is less aggressive)</p>
        <p>• 1 Pint grape Tomatoes or 1 large vine ripened Tomato, diced</p>
        <p>• 4 sweet peppers (Red, Yellow, Orange) seeded and diced</p>
        <p>Start by whisking the dressing ingredients. Taste your dressing and add more of whatever seems to be lacking. Typically that’s salt but I found <p>that I needed more cayenne and oregano too.
        Place the chickpeas, black beans, diced red onion, diced tomatoes, and diced peppers in a separate bowl. </p>
        <p></p>Toss with the dressing to coat and let sit for about an hour to really get the flavors mixing. Serve with a nice lamb chop or alone, your choice.
        Mangia and enjoy!
