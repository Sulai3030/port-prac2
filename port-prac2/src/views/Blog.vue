        <h5 class="mt-0"> Middle Eastern Summer Salad</h5>
        <p>
          Summer is upon us which means two things, one, it is too hot to turn
          on the stove and two salads are at their apex of deliciousness.
        </p>

        <p>
          While I was walking the aisles of my local supermarket, I walked past
          a can of chickpeas and for some reason I grabbed it and put it in my
          cart along with some black beans. I had an idea.
        </p>
        “Lets make a Greek type salad I thought.” So I bought what in my mind
        were Greek seeming ingredients and set about making a sort of Greek
        salad.

        <p>
          Ingredients:
        </p>
        <p>For the Dressing:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>4 cloves diced garlic (less if you are sensitive to the strength of
            garlic but honestly the more the merrier!</li>
            <li> 3 Tablespoons of Lemon juice (1 fresh lemon)
            <li> 6 Tablespoons of Lime juice (2 fresh Limes)
            <li> 3 Tablespoons of Olive Oil plus more to taste
            <li> ¼ cup minced fresh Basil or 1/3 cup dried basil
            <li> 1 Tablespoon chopped Parsley
            <li> 1 Teaspoon Honey
        
        
            <li>Salt (to taste)
            <li> Pepper
           <li>  ¼ Teaspoon cayenne pepper
            <li> Dash Mint
            <li> Dash Oregano For the Salad:
           <li>  1 Can Chickpeas, drained
            <li> 1 Can Black beans, drained
            <li> ½ Cup diced onion (red onion is less aggressive)
            <li> 1 Pint grape Tomatoes or 1 large vine ripened Tomato, diced
            <li> 4 sweet peppers (Red, Yellow, Orange) seeded and diced</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Start by whisking the dressing ingredients. Taste your dressing and add more of whatever seems to be lacking. Typically that’s salt but I found <p>that I needed more cayenne and oregano too.
        Place the chickpeas, black beans, diced red onion, diced tomatoes, and diced peppers in a separate bowl. </p>
        <p></p>Toss with the dressing to coat and let sit for about an hour to really get the flavors mixing. Serve with a nice lamb chop or alone, your choice.
        Mangia and enjoy!
